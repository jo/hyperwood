# Hyperwood Brand Usage Policy

Version 1.0 – May 2025

**Hyperwood** is an open-source project distributed under a free software license. The name “Hyperwood” and associated branding are important to the project's identity and reputation. To avoid confusion and ensure consistent quality, we ask all community members to respect the following guidelines:

## 1. Use of the Name “Hyperwood”

- Use of the name “Hyperwood” in project names, domains, public services, or marketing is **only permitted with prior approval**.
- Please contact us before registering any domains or launching public-facing services that include “Hyperwood” in the name.

## 2. Permitted Use

- You may refer to the project in an appropriate, non-misleading way (e.g., “A plugin for Hyperwood” or “Tutorial for Hyperwood”).
- You may use the name in non-commercial contexts (e.g., blog posts, slides) **as long as it's clear that the content is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with the project**.

## 3. Prohibited Use

- You may not use the name “Hyperwood” in a way that suggests official status or affiliation without permission.
- This includes domains like `hyperwood.xyz`, `gethyperwood.com`, etc., unless explicitly authorized.

## 4. Licensing and Collaboration

We are open to partnerships! If you would like to build a service, community hub, or extension related to Hyperwood, we’re happy to discuss possible branding options (e.g., “Powered by Hyperwood”, co-branding, etc.).
