# Hyperwood – Open-Source Furniture

Hyperwood is an open-source system for crafting furniture from simple wooden
slats. In the spirit of E.F. Schumacher's Small is Beautiful and inspired by
Enzo Mari’s Autoprogettazione, Hyperwood empowers anyone — DIY enthusiasts,
designers, interior architects, and small manufacturers — to build beautiful,
robust furniture using minimal tools and locally sourced materials.

Algorithms automatically generate personalized construction plans and optimized
material lists, making building accessible, sustainable, and waste-efficient.
